*** Step **** 1.
****************

You need the complete wine-package. This includes
the wine-binaries, libraries, utilities and include-files.

Wine changes all the time, so the safest thing to do is
to is to install the following version of wine:
http://www.notam02.no/arkiv/src/vstserver-wine.tar.bz2
This is necesarry, because 90% of the bug-reports I get
is because wine changes so much.

If you want to try the latest version of wine instead
of vstserver-wine (allthough it probably wont work with
the vstserver), you'll find it here: http://wwww.winehq.com

To install wine, the following procedure normally works fine:

bzip2 -d vstserver-wine.tar.bz2
tar xvf vstserver-wine.tar
cd wine
tool/wineinstall




****************
*** Step **** 2.
****************

Set the environment variable $VST_PATH to a directory where
you have your vst-plugins. It must be a unix path
(starting with '/') and not an msdos path.



****************
*** Step **** 3.
****************

After that, just writing "make" inside the vstserver directory
should compile up everything. (hopefully).

If you have wine installed somewhere else than in
/usr/local/, change the "WINEPATH" variable at the top of the makefile.

After compiling, do "make install" as root.
